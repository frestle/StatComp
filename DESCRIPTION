Description: With a method raised by WEI LIN, PIXU SHI, RUI FENG AND HONGZHE LI, this package provide a function estimate() to do regression with compositional covariates so as to estimate the coefficients, note that before using this function, matrix X and vector y should be centralized first; moreover, this package provides a function sirs() written by Rcpp to implement SIRS algorithm, in addition, all of my homework of the cource "statistic computing" is included.
